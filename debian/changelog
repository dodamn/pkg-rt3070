      - Fix WPS issue: Check SelectRegistrar is TRUE or FALSE.
      - Fix WPS issue: Some AP (ex. Buffalo WZR-AG300NH) would change SSID to 
        another SSID after push WPS PBC button. After WPS process finish, 
        change SSID to original SSID. Driver needs to wait AP to
        re-generate Beacon; otherwise, driver will update this PBC SSID to
        MlmeAux.

      - For GPL issue: Separate three kernel modules - util module,
        driver module, netif module. util module and netif module could
        license GPL. Driver module couldn't license GPL.
      - Support CFG80211 of Linux Kernel 2.6.32.
